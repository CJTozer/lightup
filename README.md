# lightup-py

Initially I wanted a really small binary, that I was going to build in C++ and use `libgit2`, learn `bazel` for builds, and all would be joyous.

However that turned into such a vast faff that I'm going with Python 3 instead, where I sort of just know I can get _something_ working in a reasonable time!
